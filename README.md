# milk-store-FE

## Background
A small local milk shop needs your help desperately. Lately they started getting a lot of business, and they feel that they need a proper website to take a load off their store. The milk at this store is sold by the liter, and if you thought there was only one type of milk you are waay off! There will be several different types of milk, and you need to make sure that the customer can easily find the type they want! The requirements wonâ€™t tell you everything, some parts you need to figure out yourself.

## Technical requirements
- Frontend: React & TypeScript
- Backend: Java

## Requirements
- Populate a database with this JSON: https://github.com/saltstudy/pgp-test-milkApp-json
- As the customer enters the site they should be met with all the cards of milk that are in storage
- A search bar where they can search based on name 
- A filter function that can filter out different types of milk; whole milk, oat milk, pea milk, almond milk, rice milk, coconut milk, soy milk, walnut milk, macadamia milk, hemp milk, cashew milk
- The customer should be able to click on a card and be redirected to the product 
  - Info should be displayed
  - A slider, or an number input, to choose how much liter they want to order
  - An order button. When this is clicked it should be clear that the order is done and the storage should be updated

## Optional requirements
If you have time over here are some more parts you can add
- Pagination; There are 99 products, so to divide the products to pages could be good 
- A cart; maybe the customer wants many different types of products. So a cart and checkout page could be useful!
- Deploy your application!
